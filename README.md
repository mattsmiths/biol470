# BIOL-470
Welcome to the code repository for BIOL470: Systems and Behavioral Neuroscience

## Week 11
Processing our EEG data and coming up with meaningful interpretation 

## Week 10
Using EEGs to look at neural correlates of listening to music

## Week 9
We compared speech patterns of lecture transcripts across sleep data for an understanding speech & communication and the intersection with sleep and neural implications

## Week 8
The following code and data was collected in week 7, we then processed this using the following code
